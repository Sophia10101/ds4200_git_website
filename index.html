    <p>Hi, I am sophia! I am a junior at northeastern university studying data science and
       psychology. I love to travel and I have been to many different countries. My favorite
       places in the world are Mykonos and London. <br>I have lived in Los Angeles, Boston, Moscow, and
       Thessaloniki. Additionally, I have traveled to over 20 cities in the United states and 19 different
       cities in Europe. I lived in Moscow, Russia for 14 months to pursue<br> a figure skating career and train width
       olympic level coaches. Throughout my figure skating career I traveled across the world to attend skating camps attend
       meet other coaches who could help advance my career. My <br> favorite skating camp was in Switzerland and I attended a few years
       in a row. After I quit figure skating I still had a love for traveling and this is what fueled my decision to participate
       in the nuin program at northeastern. <br>I spent my first semester of college in Thessaloniki, Greece and it was an amazing 
       experience because I got to travel to so many countries during my time there. I ate food for many different cultures, saw historical monuments<br>
       like the coloseum, big ben, the spanish steps, castles, and famous art pieces. I plan to continue to pursue my love of travel in the future
       and hope to be able to visit places I have never been such as Japan, Madrid, and Portugal. </p>
