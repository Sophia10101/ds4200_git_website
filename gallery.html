    <h2>More about my travels...</h2> 
    <p>
While studying abroad, I was able to visit London, Mykonos, Rome, Vienna, Athens, Delphi, Santorini, and Amsterdam. <br>
Each destination offered something completely unique, which made every trip unforgettable. London was full of things to do, with beautiful parks, <br>
famous landmarks, and incredible shopping. Mykonos had the most stunning beaches and sunsets I have ever seen, and the food there was amazing. <br>
Rome felt like walking through history, with the Colosseum and ancient ruins around every corner. Vienna impressed me with its elegant architecture <br>
and delicious pastries. Athens and Delphi gave me the opportunity to explore important archaeological sites and learn more about the origins of Western civilization. <br>
Santorini was picture-perfect with its white buildings and blue domes overlooking the sea, and I loved every moment there. Amsterdam was charming with its canals, bikes everywhere, and fun city atmosphere. <br>
Traveling to these places helped me become more independent, adaptable, and open-minded. I gained a deeper appreciation for different cultures and learned so much outside of the classroom. </p>
